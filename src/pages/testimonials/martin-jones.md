heading: Martin Jones, Climate-KIC Online Education Programme Manager and Learning Architect
subheading: Tekdi has worked on a large-scale online education project with Climate-KIC over many months. It has proved a strong and collaborative partner and has helped us to deliver a powerful and innovative online learning platform using Joomla and Shika. Tekdi’s technical competence and willingness to listen have been key to this. But of equal importance has been the strength of its entire team’s commitment to deliver, come what may. They have been a pleasure to work with.
