## **Industry – Associations**

Associations are increasingly tasked to drive the value chain of information, knowledge, and innovation. Faced with a continuous challenge of limited audience and limited revenue channels, organizations are increasingly struggling to create value for their member base. Declining memberships and attendance are further contributing to this gap and not demonstrating value and benefits to their members can mean there will be a direct impact on their health and growth. Given this, “digital,” “insights” & governance “will play a critical role to re-model this industry in these pivotal times.

Digital enablement will be a game changer as transformation is crucial in changing times. For all you know, change could not have come at a better time. Associations sometimes depend on several small businesses as a lot of their members run small and medium businesses. Small businesses are the pillar of a strong economy and the reality is that they can never afford “market research” but can instead leverage from association fees and get access to this value chain. Technology can drive this level of transformation and make information accessible and ready for use. The amount of information related to your industry is on the rise. While this can be good, it can also be overwhelming. Managing the information and the research becomes critical to unplug insights into research and get a proper handle on the knowledge base. As the Programs grow and Associations scale in terms of both members and the content related to policy matters and governance, management of content assets becomes more critical. Unlike other industries, this industry relies heavily on governance and accountability. Good governance drives ethics, leadership and promotes trust and a feeling of belonging. Members look up to other members in matters of policy, regulations, procedures, and best practices.  A process of inclusion always goes a long way and is fundamental to the growth and success of Associations.

Our solutions for Associations help our customers to organize, manage, administrate, streamline as well as gain insights into the day to day workflow of the various functions that are part of your ecosystem. Tekdi’s platform is modular, designed for scale and is extensible. We use object relationships to drive engagement and smooth administration. Knowing that your needs are extremely specific to your Business, we model our platform to become a replica of your business model. This outside in view helps us to align and create workflows that are aligned to your existing processes. So instead of providing technology for your needs, we provide you with an open platform that you can build for your business model without trying to change too much. Automation always has an objective. Our automation principles are designed on best practices and we provide you with both – an isolated view of your system that can benefit individual members to access just what they need as well as create a system of governance around your IT policies and procedures and even your practice. At “Tekdi” we also believe in empowering our users to co-create, co-produce and share information for the benefit of communities and keeping that in mind our platform is built on the fundamental premise of open source technologies. Open source projects lower barriers to access and allow members to use these tools to help themselves or those around them. The accessibility of these knowledge assets foster innovation and drive engagement. Engaged members promote membership and create a strong positivity amongst fellow members creating a sense of ownership. Tekdi’s platform also provides data and insights to their members to expand access to information and know-how. Event specific analysis or Policy specific analysis can help members make better decisions and gain valuable insights on new policy matters or changing regulations. Industry insights are highly sought after by members and providing this information directly increases the value that the members get from the platform.
