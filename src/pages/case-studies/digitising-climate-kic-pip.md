EIT Climate-KIC is a European knowledge & innovation community, working towards a prosperous, inclusive, climate-resilient society founded on a circular, zero-carbon economy. Climate-KIC’s ‘Pioneers into Practice’ (PIP) programme is a development and placement programme aimed at professionals who want to be the next generation of climate innovators.
