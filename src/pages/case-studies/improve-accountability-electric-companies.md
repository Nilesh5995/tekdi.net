Prayas is a non-profit working for interests of disadvantaged sections of society. The Energy group is one of the groups under Prayas working for "Comprehensive, analysis-based approach to further public interest in the energy sector with the goal of democratising energy governance through research and intervention in policy and regulatory areas; and offering training and support to civil society groups."

One of the projects undertaken by Prayas was to build a India-wide network of devices that monitor the quality of electrical power. Uptime and voltage fluctuations are some of the key parameters monitored. The data captured by these devices is available on a public dashboard for everybody to view. The goal of the project was to make this data available to civil groups to rally support for improved access to good quality power.

Prayas needed a technology partner to implement a public platform that had the visualizations based on the data and to also make available the raw data to researchers.


### Solution
Tekdi was able to quickly build

The devices are plugged into electrical sockets at various locations throughout the country. The devices capture data every minute, and the captured data is uploaded to a central server periodically. A background process picks up data from the central location

The project was one of the winners of the <a href="https://impactchallenge.withgoogle.com/india2013/charities/prayas" target="_blank">Google Impact Challenge</a> in 2013.
