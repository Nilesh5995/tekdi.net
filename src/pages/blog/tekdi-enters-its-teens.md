Teens is that time between being a child and an adult when you start experiencing freedom & start liking the taste of it. It's that time when you slowly start taking the controls of your life into your own hands. It is like the first time you drive a car on a learner’s license with an adult [riding shotgun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riding_shotgun). It's that time when your parents slowly start transitioning to being ‘guardians’ and helping you take control.
 
Depending on the nature of the business and the experience of its leaders, companies will most likely go through similar phases. When the company is just getting started, it needs careful nurturing & constant care from its leaders.

As it grows more people are added to the team, a culture starts to form and systems are put in place to allow the company to function in some areas ‘on its own’. This independence will free its leadership to start nurturing various aspects of the company to help it grow bigger and better in its areas of focus. It is a time to dream, experiment and go after aspirations with a passion and hunger. It is a time to explore, a time to build on the experience and guidance and grow.

As Tekdi turns 13, it is a time for us to reflect and a time to look forward.

Tekdi was born back in 2006 in a one-room office with the simple goal of creating a vehicle that allowed its founders to pursue their passions and make a positive impact on the world while doing that. We’ve evolved over the years & grown in every sense. We’ve achieved all the conventional measurements of growth - clients, revenues, team members.

More importantly over the last few years, we’ve rediscovered ourselves. What makes us Tekdi. What we are, What makes us tick and why we do what we do. This, we think has given us a powerful insight on where we want to go and what we want to do in the near future.

The magic of creation has always given us a kick. Software development gave us a tool to do just that. We love taking on challenges and solving problems.

We like to make challenges even more challenging by trying to build things in a more generic way where possible. This means whether we are building our own products or consulting customers on specific projects - we will always try to build it like a product. One that solves problems for multiple use cases, for multiple people.

This approach has over the years enabled us to create a large repository of Open Source code and a variety of Products. Empowered by this codebase and knowledge gained over the years we’ve empowered thousands of clients across the globe. Our code is also alive in cloud products that are reaching hundreds of thousands of people worldwide. Products like JGive have helped raised funds for people in need and Shika is helping empower learning. We’ve recently worked with the Government of India to redesign and redevelop the website of the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI), under the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY).

All in all its been a supremely exciting journey where we have been exposed to a plethora of experiences, met fantastic people on the way and worked on some amazing challenges - all of which has moulded us into what we are today. So we’d like to take this opportunity to thank everyone who has been part of this journey and helped make us what we are.

As we enter our teens we are brimming with new ideas and aspirations . We are eager to explore new horizons and reach new heights. Systems, processes and a passionate team have made us stronger to take on new challenges with a renewed vigour.

You can expect to see a lot of that - whether it’s in our work with Joomla and other PHP Frameworks or with our foray into the world of Javascript and Angular which has been a growing focus over the last 3-4 years.

To conclude, Happy Birthday to us !
