At Tekdi, we believe that the best innovations can be made on a strong foundation of sharing. Be it sharing code or sharing knowledge, we are always at the forefront of contributing back all we can. On the first Saturday of every month, everyone at Tekdi gets together for a “Fun2learn Saturday” which is a day filled with Hackathons, Opensource contribution events & tech talks.

A lot has changed since we entered into “Work from Home” mode back in March and our innovative ‘hackathon team’ has adapted superbly & have been churning out some awesome ‘Remote events’ for our ecosystem.

On the 1st of August, Tekdian’s got together for the first edition of “T3 - Tekdi Tech Talks” a full day focussing on talks on topics ranging from communication to coding.  Some talks specifically focussed on the ‘new normal’ of working (from home) and speakers shared insights on how to make it fun, interesting & effective.

We had 8 in-house speakers talking about various facets like - ways to Improve Communication Skills, how to do Work From Home Effectively, Email Security and Privacy, Effective Time Management Skills, and technical strands like Django - Python, JS form Library & What's new @ EkStep. We also had Philip Walton from the Joomla Release team briefing us about the upcoming ‘WFH Pizza and Bugs Event.

To relax our audience and speakers a bit after such productive sessions, we had arranged some fun activities like memory games, the princess of Persia, and movie emoji games. We also had a quick birthday celebration for our birthday boys and girls before wrapping up the day. 

Arranging such a comprehensive and ingenious event virtually and managing all the technical and non-technical activities to and fro is a challenging task. Our hackathon team at Tekdi Technologies manages all these very fluently on every “Fun2learn” Saturday. We are very thankful for our entire hackathon management team - Manoj L, Priyanka Sahu, Poonam Baravkar, Shivam, Shraddha Sankpal, Vijay Khollam, Vaibhav,  Mangesh Mane, and Aishwarya Bagawade.
