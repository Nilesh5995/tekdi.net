  description: >
    Moving over typical classroom training, learning is now anytime, anywhere and also unstructured at times. We help organisations deploy, track and measure learning outcomes and make learning a strategic initiative.

Continuous learning and assessment have become an integral part of professional lives too. It is becoming more and more evident that technical enablement and continuous adoption of the latest technology are pushing the education system to a new level. 

We have helped multiple organisations by building solutions that provide a central learning and training management platform with content from multiple partners. The solutions support complex learning workflows, e-commerce and complex reporting dashboards.

We have also helped the organisation by extending the platform to enable the online assessment, certifications and interviews. The platforms will be further enabled with AI-based skill gap analysis and intelligent attendance system for online and classroom sessions.
