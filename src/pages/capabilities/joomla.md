Truth be told, Joomla is close to our hearts at Tekdi. It is something we strongly believe in. We forayed into the world of Joomla by chance in the year 2006, right around the time of the mambo days back then and over the years we have  built a strong legacy of developing large platforms as well as complex CMS sites that scale to several million user hits in a week. This capability saw us taking part in large domestic and global projects where scale, extensibility, modularity, and performance were key to success. 

### Open Source & the Community Connect

At Tekdi, we have a strong commitment to opensource & believe in giving back to projects we build on. With Joomla we regularly contribute code & bug fixes, help organise Joomla Events in India, Speak & attend Joomla Events world wide & our entire team regularly participates in the world wide Joomla Bug fixing events.  

### Techjoomla
Started in 2009 to give our Joomla based offerings a dedicated home, it has since grown to serve a community of 100,000+ users through our free & commercial open source products. Our product kitty & Github repositories boast of 50+ products and offer a rich toolset for a variety of use cases from Ecommerce to Elearning & REST APIs to Enterprise reporting & Dashboarding.

> A key open source contribution from Techjoomla has been com_api - a REST API extension for Joomla. Developers across the globe use this extension to add REST APIs to Joomla so that the APIs can be used to build Mobile apps, or to connect Joomla to 3rd party software like Mailchimp and Salesforce.
